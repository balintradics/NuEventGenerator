# NuEventGenerator
Simple neutrino-nucleon QEL CC scattering event generator based on the ROOT TGenPhaseSpace class.

It evaluates the Llewellyn-Smith CC quasi-elastic differential cross-section using a Fermi Motion parametrization after Bodek and Ritchie (earlier Fantoni and Benhar) of the nucleon initial state. Applies a simple removal energy on the initial nucleon state and Pauli blocking on the final state. Assumes an Argon nuclear target. It is meant for educational purposes only.
